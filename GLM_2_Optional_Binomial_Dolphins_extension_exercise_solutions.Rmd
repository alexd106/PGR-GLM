# Optional extension to Binomial (Bernoulli) GLM - dolphin behavioural plasticity

\  

This extension to the dolphin data analysis is for those who may be a bit ahead and would like to :

* get some experience dealing with interactions between categorical predictors (relevant to both LMs and GLMs)
* test your understanding of the binomial GLMs for the analysis of Bernoulli data, by repeating the approach of the previous exercise with a slightly more advanced model:
  + model specification
  + model validation
  + interpreting a model graphically
* get more experience with model selection in GLMs (using AIC)

I recommend you continue with your previous R script for the GLM_2 exercise, in your RStudio Project. 

\  

13\. To address the limitations of the previous analysis, fit a new model with categorical predictors only, and interactions between them, two by two: `fTide4 + fMonth + fTime6 + fTide4:fMonth + fTide4:fTime6 + fMonth:fTime6`. What hypotheses do these interactions correspond to?

\  

```{r Q13, eval=TRUE, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE}
PA2<- glm(presence ~ fTide4 + fMonth + fTime6 + 
            fTide4:fMonth + fTide4:fTime6 + 
            fMonth:fTime6, family= binomial, data= dat)

summary(PA2) # inspect the model coefficients

# fTide4:fMonth assumes that the effect of tidal state on dolphin presence
# (actually, probability of recording) changes according to time of year

# fTide4:fTime6 assumes that the effect of tidal state on dolphin presence
# changes according to time of day (or vice-versa)

# fMonth:fTime6 assumes that the effect of time of day on dolphin presence
# changes according to time of year

```

\  

14\. Perform model selection "by hand" using the AIC, and construct an AIC table, using the example in the lecture. "By hand" means without using `drop1` or `step` functions. You can get the AIC value from the model summary `summary(YourModel)` or by typing `AIC(YourModel)`. There are 18 possible models in total, including the full model above. You can choose to evaluate all 18 models in a completely exploratory (the "ignorant and brave") approach, or only a selection of models based on more specific research questions or predictions of your own (the "clear thinker" approach).

* Example: *"We know/expect that dolphins are affected by A, B and C, but I suspect that the effect of B varies depending on the value of A whereas my colleague thinks that the effect of B depends on the value of C"*, which would suggest comparing the following models to find out which hypothesis is best supported by the data:
  + A + B + C + A:B
  + A + B + C + B:C
  + A + B + C

\  

```{r Q14a, eval=TRUE, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE}
# Because I don't have specific predictions here, and I suspect the presence
# of dolphins at Sutors may respond to all combinations of the 3 environmental
# factors we have, I'll go for a quite systematic exploration here (you may
# have a different logic, knowledge about dolphins, more specific predictions, 
# and a more restricted list of models you consider plausible: that would be
# entirely fine)

# remove interactions one-at-a-time
PA21<- glm(presence ~ fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6 + fMonth:fTide4 + fMonth:fTime6, family= binomial, data= dat)
PA22<- glm(presence ~ fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6 + fMonth:fTime6 + fTide4:fTime6, family= binomial, data= dat)
PA23<- glm(presence ~ fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6 + fMonth:fTide4 + fTide4:fTime6, family= binomial, data= dat)
# remove interactions two-at-a-time
PA24<- glm(presence ~ fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6 + fMonth:fTime6, family= binomial, data= dat)
PA25<- glm(presence ~ fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6 + fTide4:fTime6, family= binomial, data= dat)
PA26<- glm(presence ~ fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6 + fMonth:fTide4, family= binomial, data= dat)
# remove all interactions
PA27<- glm(presence ~ fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6, family= binomial, data= dat)

AIC(PA2)
AIC(PA21)
AIC(PA22)
AIC(PA23)
AIC(PA24)
AIC(PA25)
AIC(PA26)
AIC(PA27)

# PA24 seems best so far

# remove the main effect not involved in the interaction of PA24 (fTide4)
PA28<- glm(presence ~ fMonth + fTime6 + fMonth:fTime6, family= binomial, data= dat)
AIC(PA28)

# we could simplify further, but it is unlikely that simpler models 
# would be supported based on what we know, so I'll stop here

# Constructing a table 
# (you can do this with pen and paper, or in R, for example like this)
ModelStructure<- c(
  "fTide4 * fMonth + fTide4 * fTime6 + fMonth * fTime6",     
  "fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6 + fMonth:fTide4 + fMonth:fTime6",
  "fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6 + fMonth:fTime6 + fTide4:fTime6" ,
  "fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6 + fMonth:fTide4 + fTide4:fTime6",
  "fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6 + fMonth:fTime6",
  "fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6 + fTide4:fTime6",
  "fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6 + fMonth:fTide4",
  "fMonth + fTide4 + fTime6",
  "fMonth + fTime6 + fMonth:fTime6")

AICval<- c(AIC(PA2),
            AIC(PA21),
            AIC(PA22),
            AIC(PA23),

            AIC(PA26),
            AIC(PA27),
            AIC(PA28))

ModelName<- c("PA2",
            "PA21",
            "PA22",
            "PA23",
            "PA24",
            "PA25",
            "PA26",
            "PA27",
            "PA28")

# combine models and AIC values in a table
ModSelTab<- data.frame(model= ModelName, structure= ModelStructure, AIC= AICval)

# sort the table by increasing AIC value
ModSelTab<- ModSelTab[order(ModSelTab$AIC), ]

# compute AIC differences with best model, and round to 2 decimals
ModSelTab$delta<- round(ModSelTab$AIC - ModSelTab$AIC[1], 2)

# compute AIC weight, and round to 2 decimals
ModSelTab$weight<- round(exp(-ModSelTab$delta / 2) / sum(exp(-ModSelTab$delta / 2)), 2)
```

```{r Q14b, eval=TRUE, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE}
require(knitr)
kable(ModSelTab)

# Model PA24 is far ahead, with an AIC more than 5 units lower than the next best model.
# It attracts almost all the AIC weight, accordingly.

# Depending on the set of models you decided to compare, 
# your best model and AIC weights may vary from mine.

```

\  

15\. Do the validation of your best model, using the approach taken in question 7.

\  

```{r Q15, eval=TRUE, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE, fig.show= ifelse(SOLUTIONS, "asis", "hide"), fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
res24.p<- resid(PA24, type= "pearson")

library(arm)
par(mfrow= c(2, 2))
binnedplot(x= as.numeric(dat$fTide4), y=  res24.p, xlab= "Tide angle", nclass= 100)
# okay
binnedplot(x= as.numeric(dat$fTime6), y=  res24.p, xlab= "hour")
# okay
binnedplot(x= dat$julianday, y=  res24.p, xlab= "Day of the year", nclass= 100)
# okay
# We could also check seasonal variation in diel pattern ("time by season" interaction):
matplot(tapply(res24.p, list(dat$mon, dat$fTime6), mean), type= "l", 
        xlab= "month", ylab= "proportion of hours present", lty= 1)
# Residual variation is tiny (check y-axis and compare with Question 9); 
# no consistent pattern of variation. Pretty good!

# There are few assumptions for the Bernoulli distribution other than 
# observations being zeros and ones.
# Some assumptions valid for all models still apply here, such as: model 
# correctly specified; independent
# residuals. The latter is violated in this data set, due to consecutive 
# measurements in time. This issue
# is explored in the linked paper, using mixed models for non-independent data 
# (covered in the course BI5302). 
# The paper also uses GAMs (Generalised Additive Models, an extension of GLMs)
# for avoiding the discretization of continuous variables, and
# accounting for the cyclicity of the predictors (estimates at each end should 
# match, e.g. 31st Dec-1st Jan, or 23:59 - 00:00)

```

\  

16\. Interpret the model, using plots of the predictions (use the approach taken in question 9) .

\  

```{r Q16, eval=TRUE, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE, fig.show= ifelse(SOLUTIONS, "asis", "hide"), fig.height=8, , fig.width=8}

# Model PA24 assumes that dolphin presence (actually, probability of recording) 
# changes according to time of year, time of day and tidal stage, and that the
# effect of time of day changes with the time of year (fMonth:fTime6).

summary(PA24)
# This is tricky to interpret due to the number of coefficients (75), 
# and the presence of interactions. Best to use plots!

# Let's illustrate the differences in predictions for two different months, 
# for example June and December (this could be done for each of the 12 months)

par(mfrow= c(1, 2))
# June

                fMonth= "12",
								fTide4= "1")

# In June, dolphins seem to have a similar probability of being recorded
# at any time of the day and night, whereas in December they are mostly
# using the site by night (ca. 40% chances of being present against 
# only ca. 10% in the middle of the day)

# (FOR THE R GEEKS OUT THERE)
# For plots of predictions for all 12 months, it is possible to automate
# the process using a loop:
par(mfrow= c(3, 4))
for(month in 1:12){ 
  # at the first iteration, the variable `month` will take value 1, then
  # at the second iteration, the variable `month` will take value 2, 
  # etc... until iteraction 12
	dat4pred<- expand.grid(fTime6= levels(dat$fTime6),
                                fMonth= as.character(month),
								fTide4= "1")
	PA24.pred<- predict(PA24, dat4pred, type= "link", se.fit= T)
	dat4pred$fit.resp<- plogis(PA24.pred$fit)
	dat4pred$LCI<- plogis(PA24.pred$fit - 1.96*PA24.pred$se.fit)
	dat4pred$UCI<- plogis(PA24.pred$fit + 1.96*PA24.pred$se.fit)
	plot(as.numeric(dat4pred$fTime6), dat4pred$fit.resp, pch= 16, 
		  cex= 1.4, main= paste("Month =", month),
          col= 1, xlab= "Section of day",
		  ylab= "Fitted probability (assuming Tide = 1)", ylim= c(0, 1))
	arrows(x0= as.numeric(dat4pred$fTime6), x1= as.numeric(dat4pred$fTime6),
          y0= dat4pred$LCI, y1= dat4pred$UCI,
		  col= grey(0.5), length= 0.02, angle= 90, code= 3)
} # end of one iteration, start of the next

# According to the better supported model, they tend to use the site
# more in May, June and 
# July day and night, visit mostly by night from October to December,
# and seldom from Jan to March.

# Of note is the low proportion of deviance explained by the model,
# despite its complexity (75 parameters):
(PA24$null.deviance - PA24$deviance) /
	PA24$null.deviance 
# 10%. However, this is quite normal with Bernoulli data,
# since they do not contain a great deal of information

**End of the optional extension to Binomial (Bernoulli) GLM exercise**

\  

**For info,** the publication here offers a different approach to analysing these data, using slightly fancier GLMs with smooth terms (called GAMs, for Generalized Additive Models), and a few additional refinements: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38900-4]. What assumptions differ between this and your approach?
