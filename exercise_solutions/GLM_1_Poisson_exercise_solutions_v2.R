# anova is useful for getting an idea of the relative contributions
# of each term, but beware that order does matter for all but the last term!

# drop1 would provide the same answer in this case, since there are
# no other interactions involved (and interactions are always last). 
# In general this would be the method of choice if our purpose is 
# to perform model simplification.

drop1(sp.glm2, test= "Chisq")

# the ANOVA table provides a global test across pH levels. 
# However the significance of the interactions is also unambiguous
# from the summary table, in this case, although the null hypothesis
# is different (coefficient different from zero in the latter 
# vs. significant proportion of variation explained in the former).

vif(sp.glm2)

# GVIF is high for all the terms.
# This is expected though, because all terms are part of an interaction. 
# Any change in one coefficient will have a strong impact on the others
# This might be exacerbated by the pre-existing correlation between 
# the predictors. But all components are very clearly needed here.
