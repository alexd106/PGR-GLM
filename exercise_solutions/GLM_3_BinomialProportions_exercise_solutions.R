## Mathematical model description:

# Prop_surviving ~ Binomial(Ntot, P) 
# log(P / (1-P)) = 
#         1.43 - 3.80*Concentration 
#         + 0.0085*fToxic2 + 0.014*fToxic3 + 0.27*fToxic4 
#         - 6.18*Concentration:fToxic2
#         - 1.90*Concentration*fToxic3 
#         + 1.48*Concentration*fToxic4

## "biological" hypotheses:

# (Intercept):     the mean (on the logit scale) for Toxic 1 when its
# concentration is 0 (null hypothesis not very useful, however
# the value is quite interesting, when back-transformed on the proportion
# scale: this is the proportion that survive the experiment in the absence
# of toxic chemical. Shouldn't differ between chemicals, presumably?)

# Concentration: slope of Concentration, or change in survival per unit
# increase in Toxic 1 concentration (on logit link), or change in log-odds
# of survival (on proportion scale)

# fToxic2:       difference between intercepts of Toxic 2 and Toxic 1
# fToxic3:       difference between intercepts of Toxic 3 and Toxic 1
# fToxic4:       difference between intercepts of Toxic 4 and Toxic 1

# Concentration:fToxic2  difference between Conc. slopes for Toxic 2 and
# Toxic 1. Negative means a more lethal effect than Toxic 1

# Concentration:fToxic3  difference between Conc. slopes for Toxic 2 and Toxic 1
# Concentration:fToxic4  difference between Conc. slopes for Toxic 2 and Toxic 1

# Yes, because this is a binomial variable with more than 1 trial per observation
# Residual deviance: 117.67  on 107  degrees of freedom
# -> negligible overdispersion



## ----Q7, eval=TRUE, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE--------------------------------------------
# we don't need to perform model selection here: given that the assay is
# to compare the effect of different chemicals, the interaction alone is the
# focus of the experiment. If it is not significant, we would have our answer
# and the simplified model wouldn't have much use.

# no difference between  chemicals.

vif(M1)

# extremely high VIF values: are they a problem?
# Not particularly:
# The cause probably lies with the choice of the researchers to stop increasing
# the concentration when 100% mortality was reached (or close to), leading to
# small sample size for high concentrations in the most potent chemicals.
# Nevertheless their approach was sufficient to get decent estimates of the
# curves for each treatment, with sufficient precision still to get significant
# differences. Adding more assays at higher concentrations (which presumably
# would have yield close to 100% mortality as well), for the sake of getting a
# more balanced design would make little difference to the estimates.

# The Pearson residuals are quite different from the the raw or deviance residuals in this example,
# because when predicted values are small (near p=0), the variance of the binomial distribution is very
# small. Pearson residuals being the raw residuals (difference between observed and predicted) divided
# by the sqrt of the variance (a very small value), the Pearson residuals can thus be very large even
# if the raw residual isn't.

# Some trends in the residuals against concentration, suggesting that a straight
# line on the logit scale is not a perfect fit for these data. The model remains
# good enough for its purpose of evidencing differences in the toxicity between
# chemicals
