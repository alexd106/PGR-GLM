# Model diagnostic plots:
# Residuals vs Fitted
  # We see a fairly clear "funnel" pattern. We go from having relatively "little" variation
  # when our predicted values (on the link scale) are small, to "lots" of variation
  # when our predicted values are large, and most of this is happening between predicted
  # values of 2.5 to 3.5 (so over a fairly small range of predicted values)
  # This would suggest we're not meeting the assumptions particularly well and
  # is a good indication that we have overdispersion.
# Q-Q Residuals
  # We completely ignore this figure for GLMs.
# Scale-Location
  # We also don't want to see any patterns (as for Resids vs Fitted) but we see the
  # same rapid increase in variation once predicted values are above 2.5
# Residuals vs Leverage
  # We're really only using this to check for values close to a Cook's distance of 1
  # While we don't have any observations that are greater than 1, we have a handful
  # that are getting uncomfortably close. While these values are fine, we're
  # not exactly jumping for joy with these Cook's distances.
# Overall, the diagnostic plots don't look great. Not the worst, but we'd want something
# better.

# To do a quick and crude check for dispersion, we can use the information from summary()
  # We take residual deviance and divide by the degrees of freedom, so for this model:
  # 432.63/88 = 4.9!
  # We have a whopping 4.9 overdispersion! My general rule of thumb is that I start getting
  # concerned when dispersion is somewhere in the 1.5-1.8 region. 4.9 is doomsday!
  # As a result, our standard error for our parameter estimates is going to be artificially
  # small. This in turn leads to both 1) risks of our p value being smaller than it should be
  # for Biomass, and 2) any predictions that include uncertainty being too confident.

# "(Intercept)" is the predicted value on the link (log) scale when
# pH is "low". A hint is that there is no labelled coefficient called
# "pHlow".

# "Biomass" is the slope of Biomass.
# It is negative, so assumes a linear decrease (on the log scale)
# For every extra 1 unit (here kg) of biomass "added" to a plot
# the number of species (on the log scale) decreases by -0.16

# "pHmid" is the estimated difference (on the log scale) between
# the "pHmid" and the reference level, "pHlow".
# A value of 0.65 means plots with "mid" pH have 0.65 (on link scale)
# more species than "low" (our intercept).

# "pHhigh" is the estimated difference (on the log scale) between
# the "pHhigh" and the reference level, "pHlow".
# A value of 1.13 means plots with "mid" pH have 1.13 (on link scale)
# more species than "low" (our intercept).

# A mathematical description of the model
# (and how I would present it in the methods section of a paper):
# Species_i ~ Poisson(lambda_i)
# log(lambda_i) = 2.76 + -0.16 * Biomass_i
